# Arc Network FX Engine - Programmatic USDC Pegging

## What is Arc Network?

Arc is Circle's **Layer 1 blockchain purpose-built for stablecoin finance**. Unlike traditional blockchains, Arc is designed from the ground up to be the "Economic OS for the internet."

**Key Philosophy:** *"Stablecoins proved that money can be programmable, now Arc carries that idea through to the rest of the global economy."*

## Arc's Native FX Engine

### What Makes Arc Different?

Most blockchains require:
- ❌ Manual liquidity pools (expensive!)
- ❌ External DEXes
- ❌ High gas fees in volatile crypto
- ❌ Slow settlement times

Arc provides:
- ✅ **Built-in FX engine** for stablecoin conversion
- ✅ **USDC as native gas** (few cents per tx)
- ✅ **Sub-second finality** (instant settlement)
- ✅ **Programmatic pegging** at protocol level
- ✅ **No external pools needed**

## How AIC Token Uses Arc's FX Engine

### The Programmatic Peg

**AIC tokens are programmatically pegged 1:1 with USDC via Arc's native Layer 1 protocol.**

This means:
1. **No liquidity pool investment needed** - Arc's protocol handles conversion
2. **Automatic price stability** - Built into Layer 1
3. **Institutional-grade settlement** - Same tech banks will use
4. **Few cents gas fees** - USDC is the native gas token

### Technical Implementation

```solidity
// AIC Token Contract on Arc
contract AICToken is ERC20 {
    // 6 decimals to match USDC on Arc
    function decimals() public pure override returns (uint8) {
        return 6;
    }

    // Mint rewards to players
    function mintGameReward(address player, uint256 amount) external {
        _mint(player, amount);
        // Arc's FX engine maintains programmatic peg
    }
}
```

## Why This Matters for AIC

### Traditional Model (Expensive)
```
Player earns AIC → Manual liquidity pool ($10,000+ investment)
→ External DEX fees → Slippage → Complex arbitrage
```

### Arc FX Model (Zero Investment)
```
Player earns AIC → Arc's FX Engine programmatic conversion
→ Instant USDC → No pools needed → No investment required
```
