# AI Cognitive Token (AiC) - Project Overview

## What is AiC?

**AI Cognitive Token (AiC)** is the world's first learn-to-earn cryptocurrency token powered by artificial intelligence. It combines cognitive learning with blockchain rewards, creating a revolutionary educational platform where knowledge literally becomes money.

## Core Concept

AiC stands for **AI Cognitive Token** - representing the intersection of:
- **AI** - Artificial Intelligence validation via OpenAI
- **Cognitive** - Learning and understanding blockchain concepts
- **Token** - USDC-backed cryptocurrency rewards

## How It Works

### The Learning-to-Earning Flow:
1. **Connect Wallet** - Users connect MetaMask to Arc Testnet
2. **Type Blockchain Terms** - Learn vocabulary like CONSENSUS, SMART-CONTRACT, DEFI
3. **AI Validation** - OpenAI GPT validates answers in real-time
4. **Instant Rewards** - Earn 300-500 AiC tokens per correct term
5. **Swap to USDC** - Convert AiC to Circle's USDC at 1:1 ratio
6. **Bridge & Withdraw** - Use Circle CCTP to transfer to any chain

## Hackathon Project

Built for **Circle's "AI Agents on Arc with USDC" Hackathon 2025**

### Demonstrates:
- **Programmable USDC** - Used for gas, rewards, and cross-chain transfers
- **AI Integration** - OpenAI validates cognitive learning
- **Arc L1 Blockchain** - Sub-second finality with native USDC
- **Circle CCTP** - Cross-chain bridge functionality
- **Real-world Use Case** - Education meets DeFi

## Technology Stack

### Blockchain Infrastructure
- **Circle Arc Layer 1** - Lightning-fast blockchain with native USDC gas
- **Smart Contracts** - AIC token minting and USDC swap contracts
- **Circle CCTP** - Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol for bridging

### AI & Backend
- **OpenAI GPT-4** - Cognitive validation engine
- **Supabase** - Database and edge functions
- **PostgreSQL** - User data and transaction history with RLS

### Frontend
- **React + TypeScript** - Modern web application
- **Viem** - Ethereum library for wallet interactions
- **Tailwind CSS** - Beautiful, responsive UI design
- **PWA Support** - Installable mobile app experience

## Smart Contract Addresses (Arc Testnet)

- **AIC Token**: `0x642cd03b73e2ad7d5e190865d8c3ec74bae6d34e`
- **AIC Swap**: `0x8d0F04d6d4e8b0B7e5b27BD3d15D53EaB3b0f9b1`
- **USDC (Arc)**: `0xe7ef447d31760456dd8a134f1e08b2fd583bfa83`

## Anti-Cheat Mechanisms

- **Copy-Paste Detection** - AI detects non-human typing patterns
- **Rate Limiting** - Prevents spam and gaming the system
- **Wallet-Based Identity** - One user per wallet address
- **On-Chain Verification** - All rewards publicly verifiable

## Real-World Impact

### Education
- Teaches blockchain vocabulary through active learning
- AI provides instant feedback and validation
- Gamifies the learning experience

### Financial Inclusion
- Earn real money by learning
- No upfront investment required
- Access to USDC rewards globally

### Web3 Adoption
- Onboards users to blockchain technology
- Demonstrates practical crypto use cases
- Builds cognitive understanding of Web3

## Future Roadmap

1. **Mainnet Launch** - Deploy on Circle Arc mainnet
2. **Expanded Curriculum** - More blockchain topics and difficulty levels
3. **NFT Certificates** - Achievement badges as NFTs
4. **Social Features** - Leaderboards, challenges, multiplayer
5. **Mobile Apps** - Native iOS and Android applications
6. **DAO Governance** - Community-driven curriculum development

## Why AiC Matters

In a world where:
- Traditional education is expensive
- Blockchain adoption is slow
- Financial inclusion is limited

**AI Cognitive Token bridges the gap** by making learning profitable, blockchain accessible, and earning achievable for everyone.
