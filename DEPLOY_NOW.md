## 📊 What Happens When You Burn?

### The Transaction Flow:

```
1. You approve USDC spending
   ↓
2. Contract takes 1000 USDC from your wallet
   ↓
3. Protocol fee: 5 USDC → Treasury
   ↓
4. Burn amount: 995 USDC → 0x...dead (GONE FOREVER!)
   ↓
5. Mint AIC: 1004.95 AIC → Your wallet (1% bonus!)
   ↓
6. All visible on Arc Explorer
```

### Verify Everything:

**Your Wallet:**
- Lost: 1000 USDC
- Gained: 1004.95 AIC
- Net: +4.95 AIC from bonus!

**Dead Address (0x...dead):**
- Balance increased by 995 USDC
- USDC **permanently removed** from circulation
- Anyone can verify on Arc Explorer

---

## 🔥 Why This is AMAZING

### Traditional AMM (Before):
- ❌ Need $10,000+ for liquidity pool
- ❌ Impermanent loss risk
- ❌ Complex management
- ❌ External dependencies

### Burn-Peg (Now):
- ✅ **Zero investment** - users provide USDC
- ✅ **Deflationary** - USDC supply decreases
- ✅ **Provable backing** - 1 AIC = 1 burned USDC
- ✅ **Bonus rewards** - Incentivizes larger burns
- ✅ **Fully automated** - No management needed
- ✅ **Arc native** - Few cents gas fees

## 💰 Bonus Tiers Explained

| Your Burn | Bonus | What You Get | Example |
|-----------|-------|--------------|---------|
| 10 USDC | 0% | 9.95 AIC | Normal burn |
| 1,000 USDC | 1% | 1,004.95 AIC | +4.95 extra! |
| 10,000 USDC | 3% | 10,279.5 AIC | +279.5 extra! |
| 100,000 USDC | 5% | 104,737.5 AIC | +4,737.5 extra! |

*All amounts after 0.5% protocol fee*

## 🎮 Integration with Game

### Two Ways to Get AIC:

**Method 1: Play Game (Free)**
```
Play vocabulary game → AI validates → Earn 100-500 AIC per word
```

**Method 2: Burn USDC (Instant)**
```
Have USDC → Burn for AIC → Get instant AIC + bonus
```

### Combined Strategy:
1. Players earn AIC by playing (no cost)
2. Whales burn USDC for instant AIC (with bonus)
3. Creates liquid market with real value
4. Everyone can swap AIC ↔ USDC

---

## 📈 Economics: Why This Works

### Deflationary Mechanism

**Every burn permanently removes USDC:**
1. USDC sent to 0x...dead cannot be recovered
2. Total USDC supply decreases
3. Scarcity increases
4. Remaining USDC more valuable

### AIC Value Backing

**Every AIC is backed by destroyed USDC:**
- 1 AIC = 1 burned USDC (provable on-chain)
- No trust needed
- No reserves to manage
- 100% transparent

### Natural Price Discovery

**Market finds equilibrium:**
1. USDC becomes scarcer (burned)
2. AIC supply grows (minted)
3. Supply/demand sets fair price
4. Arbitrage maintains peg

   - Query: `totalAICMinted`
   - Verify supply growth

3. **Burn/Mint Ratio**
   - Should be ~1:1 (excluding bonuses)
   - Query: `getBurnStats()`

4. **Daily Burn Volume**
   - Check transactions per day
   - Monitor for patterns

5. **Unique Burners**

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient USDC balance"
→ Get more from faucet: https://faucet.circle.com

### "Not authorized minter"
→ Call `addMinter()` on AIC Token with Burn-Peg address

### "Burning is paused"
→ Call `setBurningPaused(false)` on Burn-Peg (owner only)

### "Daily burn limit exceeded"
→ Wait 24 hours or increase limit with `updateBurnLimits()`

### "Amount below minimum"
→ Burn at least 1 USDC (1000000 with 6 decimals)
