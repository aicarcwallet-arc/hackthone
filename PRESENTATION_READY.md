## 💪 Your Talking Points (Memorize These!)

### **Who You Are:**
> "I'm Shazia Sayeed - founder, developer, and brain behind AI Cognitive Token. I'm a blockchain developer with expertise in blockchain technology, AI integration, and USDC stablecoin infrastructure."

### **The Problem:**
> "Education doesn't reward learners. You study blockchain for hours - gain no tangible value."

### **Your Solution:**
> "AiC Token changes that. Type blockchain terms, OpenAI validates, earn real tokens. It's learn-to-earn powered by AI and Circle's USDC."

### **The Tech:**
> "Built on Circle's Arc L1 with USDC-native gas. Uses OpenAI for real-time validation. ERC-20 tokens you can swap, bridge, or hold."

### **The Vision:**
> "This is just the beginning. Imagine students earning while studying, universities rewarding learning, education becoming income. That's the future I'm building."
