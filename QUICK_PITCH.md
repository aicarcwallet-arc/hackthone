## 🚀 The Problem & Solution (30 sec)

**"Education doesn't reward learners. You study blockchain for hours - gain no tangible value."**

**"AiC Token changes that. Type blockchain terms → OpenAI validates → Earn real tokens."**

**"It's learn-to-earn, powered by AI and Circle's USDC infrastructure."**

## 💡 How It Works (30 sec)

**Three steps:**

1. **"Play vocabulary game"** - Type blockchain words
2. **"AI validates accuracy"** - OpenAI scores in real-time
3. **"Earn AIC tokens"** - Real ERC-20 on Arc blockchain

**"Each word = 100-500 AIC. Swap for USDC, bridge to any chain, or hold."**
