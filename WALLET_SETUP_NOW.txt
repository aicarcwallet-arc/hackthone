YOUR ENTITY SECRET WAS NEVER REGISTERED WITH CIRCLE!

Run these commands RIGHT NOW:

1. Generate and register a NEW entity secret:
   npx tsx scripts/register-entity-secret.ts

2. When you see the secret (64 hex chars), COPY IT

3. Paste it when prompted

4. Update .env with the NEW secret it gives you

5. Then run:
   npx tsx scripts/create-circle-wallet.ts

6. Add the wallet ID to .env

That's it. The HTML tool won't work because the entity secret needs Circle's encryption.
